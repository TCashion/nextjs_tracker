# API type definitions
# type defines the shape of the data that is available to the API
# doesn't necessarily need to be exact match to model / data in DB
# i.e. data that comes from the API
type Habit {
    _id: ID!,
    name: String!
}

# defines what comes into the API
input HabitInput {
    _id: ID
    name: String!
}

# define what we can change
type Mutation {
    addHabit(habit: HabitInput): Habit
}

type Query {
    habits: [Habit]
}
